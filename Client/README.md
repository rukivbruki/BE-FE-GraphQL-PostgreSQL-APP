### Project Description
This is a `Vue.js` web application that displays and searches financial transactions using a `GraphQL API` and `Apollo Client`. The application features a list of transactions, filters for searching, as well as a detailed information page for each transaction.

### Instructions for Deployment
1. Ensure that you have `Node.js` and npm installed.
2. Clone the repository from GitHub.
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the Client folder using the command `cd Client`.
4. Install all dependencies using the command `npm install`.
5. Launch the application using the command `npm run dev`.

### Project Limitations
- The project does not provide the ability to edit or add new transactions.
- Full-text search for transactions is only possible if there is at least one relevant keyword spelled out completely.

### Troubleshooting Tips
- Make sure all dependencies are installed and updated to the latest version.
- Check that the GraphQL server is running and working at the address specified in the application code.
